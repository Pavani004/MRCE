OPTIONAL PROJECT:
=================
SMART CITY

Domain:
=======
Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict rainfall based on historical weather data.
Using the dataset Rainfall.csv, we train and evaluate a model, saving it as Model.pkl.
A Flask application (app.py) serves as the interface, allowing users to input weather parameters and receive rainfall predictions.

Requirements:
============
1.Python 3.12.4
2.Flask
3.Pandas
4.Scikit-learn
5.Jupyter Notebook (optional, for model development and evaluation)

Our Idea:
=========
For the given problem statement of Smart city, we have opted for single area of water scarcity. Our idea supports this by predicting the future rainfall and take preventive measures accordingly. So, that the users get information regarding this and take necessary actions.
