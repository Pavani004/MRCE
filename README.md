OPTIONAL PROJECT:
===========SMART CITY==============
Domain: Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict rainfall based on historical weather data.
Using the dataset Rainfall.csv, we train and evaluate a model, saving it as Model.pkl.
A Flask application (app.py) serves as the interface, allowing users to input weather parameters and receive rainfall predictions.
Requirements:
1.Python 3.12.4
2.Flask
3.Pandas
4.Scikit-learn
5.Jupyter Notebook (optional, for model development and evaluation)
